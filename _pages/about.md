Welcome to my personal blog! As a researcher in Graph Signal Processing and Mathematics enthusiast, this blog is dedicated to sharing my knowledge and thoughts in both of fields that may help people to understand complex mathematical structures and engage in more with the mathematical definitions. It is that I hope so :D. Or this blog may confuse you more about these subjects.

My first goal in this blog is to share some knowledge about Advanced Mathmetical treatment of Stochastic Processes. As I am not a mathematician, they will not include rigorous proofs or so but it will be about what I think about theoretical implications of main theorems in this field. 

Expertise
====
- Theoretical and practical aspects of Graph Signal Processing
- MATLAB, Python
- Pure Mathematics

Hobbies and Interests
===
When not delving into Graph Signal Processing and Mathematics, I spend my time gaming and learning etymologies of the words although I cannot say I do well at both of them.:p
