collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-tvgp
excerpt: 'The modeling of time-varying graph signals as stationary time-vertex stochastic processes permits the inference of missing signal values by efficiently employing the correlation patterns of the process across different graph nodes and time instants. In this study, we first propose an algorithm for computing graph autoregressive moving average (graph ARMA) processes based on learning the joint time-vertex power spectral density of the process from its incomplete realizations. Our solution relies on first roughly estimating the joint spectrum of the process from partially observed realizations and then refining this estimate by projecting it onto the spectrum manifold of the ARMA process. We then present a theoretical analysis of the sample complexity of learning graph ARMA processes. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves improvement in the time-vertex signal estimation performance in comparison with reference approaches in the literature.'

The modeling of time-varying graph signals as stationary time-vertex stochastic processes permits the inference of missing signal values by efficiently employing the correlation patterns of the process across different graph nodes and time instants. In this study, we first propose an algorithm for computing graph autoregressive moving average (graph ARMA) processes based on learning the joint time-vertex power spectral density of the process from its incomplete realizations. Our solution relies on first roughly estimating the joint spectrum of the process from partially observed realizations and then refining this estimate by projecting it onto the spectrum manifold of the ARMA process. We then present a theoretical analysis of the sample complexity of learning graph ARMA processes. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves improvement in the time-vertex signal estimation performance in comparison with reference approaches in the literature.
