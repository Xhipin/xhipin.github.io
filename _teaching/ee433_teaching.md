I have given EE433 Real-Time Applicactions of Digital Signal Processing at Middle East Technical University for two semesters: 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 Spring. This course is an extensive course about implementing
common Digital Signal Processing applications such as sampling, interpolation, decimation, convolution and Wiener filtering etc. both on FPGA module using LabVIEW and on MATLAB. I was and am a supervisor of 12 laboratories containing introductory and mid-level Digital Signal Processing tasks. Below you can find a sample .mlx file that is distributed as a course material.
